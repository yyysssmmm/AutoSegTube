      "text": "like crazy amount power one piece technology happen u so fast launch GPT 5 kid bear today will never smart ai do figure real not real not put sex bot avatar chatgpt yet super intelligence do actually mean thing remarkable interview Sam Alman ceo open ai open ai open ai reshaping industry dude straightup tech lord let u honest right now try build super intelligence could far exceed human almost every field release powerful model yet couple year ago would sound like science fiction not anymore fact not alone middle high stake global race u ever see hundred billion dollar unbelievable amount human worth profound moment people never live technological shift like happen around right now so episode want try time travel Sam Alman future try build see look like so can really understand come welcome huge conversation great meet thanks absolutely so dive would love tell goal okay not go ask valuation AI talent war fundraising anything like think well cover elsewhere do seem like big goal show cover can use science tech make future well reason do really believe if people see good future can then help build so goal try best time travel different moment future try build see look like Fantastic Awesome Starting announce recently say surprisingly recently gpt4 dumb model u will ever use but gpt4 can already perform good 90 human SAT lsat GRE can pass cod exam sommelier exam medical licensing now launch gpt5 can GPT5 do gpt4 can not first one important takeaway can AI system can do amazing thing say do not clearly do not replicate lot human good think say something value SAT test whatever else but think go back if conversation day gpt4 launch tell gpt4 do thing like oh man go huge impact negative impact mean bunch job know people go do know bunch positive impact might predict not yet come true uh so something way model good do not capture lot thing need people do care people suspect thing go happen GPT5 People go blow away do uh really good lot thing then will find want do even um people will use sort incredible thing uh will transform lot knowledge work lot way learn lot way create um but people society will co eolve expect know good tool so yeah like think model quite remarkable many way quite limit others but fact know 3 minute 5 minute 1 hour task uh like expert field could maybe do maybe struggle fact pocket one piece software can do thing really amazing think like unprecedented point human history technology improve much fast fact tool now know like live kind adjust step step but if could go back time five 10 year say thing come would like probably not let u assume people not see headline topline specific thing excite also thing seem caveatting thing maybe will not expect do um thing excited model first time feel like can ask kind hard scientific technical question get pretty good answer will give fun example actually uh junior high uh maybe nth grade get ti83 old graphing calculator spend so long make game call snake yeah uh popular game kid school like uh like pro dumb but like program TID3 extremely painful take long time really hard like debug whatever whim early copy gpt5 like wonder if can make ti83 style Game of Snake course do perfectly like 7 second then like okay suppose would like 11 year old self think cool like know miss something process like 3 second wonder like oh good bad then immediately say actually now miss game idea crazy new feature let type implement game live update like actually would like look way actually would like do thing like like kind experience remind like 11 program like now want try now idea now but could do so fast could like express idea try thing play thing real time like oh man know worry second kid like miss struggle learn program sort stone age way now thrill way people will able create new tool speed can sort bring idea life know pretty amazing so idea GPT5 can not like answer hard question but really create like ondemand almost instantaneous software think go one define element GPD5 era way do not exist gpd4 talk find think concept weightlift time tension yeah do not know can squat 100 pound 3 second can squat 100 pound 30 gain lot squat 30 think creative process felt like do best work require enormous amount cognitive time tension think cognitive time tension so important ironic almost tool take enormous cognitive time tension develop but way do think people might say people use escape hatch thinking way maybe now might say yeah but do calculator move harder math problem do feel like something different happen do think different mean people clearly use chachine not think people use think ever hopeful will able build tool way encourage people stretch brain little able do think like know society competitive place like if give people new tool uh theory maybe people work less but practice seem like people work ever hard expectation people go so guess like tool uh people like piece technology people will do people will do less but certainly people want use chatbt increase cognitive time tension really able take lot inspiration like top 5 engaged user do chacht like really amazing much people learn know output so GPT5 couple hour so play do think so far learn interact mean part interesting thing feel like catch use gpt4 now try learn use GPD5 curious specific task find interesting imagine use now impressed coding task mean lot thing really good but idea AI can write software anything mean can express idea new way AI can do advanced thing can do know can like sense could like ask gpt4 anything but GPT5 so good program feel like can do anything course can not do thing physical world but can get computer do complex thing software super powerful know way like control stuff actually do thing so striking um get much good write so like whole thing AI slop like AI write kind like quite annoy way dash still dash GPT5 lot people like dash but writing quality GPT5 get much well still long way go want improve but like uh thing hear lot people inside OpenAI man start use GPT5 know well metric but like nuance quality can not quite articulate but then go back gpt4 test something feel terrible do not know exactly but suspect part writing feel so much natural good preparation interview reach couple leader AI technology gather couple question okay so next question Stripe ceo Patrick Collison will good one read verbatim next stage come gbt5 year do think large language model will make significant scientific discovery miss not happen yet cave should leave math special case model like alpha fold aside specifically ask fully general purpose model like GPT series would say people will agree happen point next two year but definition significant matter lot so people significant might happen know early 25 people might maybe not late 2026 sorry early 2026 maybe people not late 2027 but would would bet late 27 people agree AIdriven significant new discovery thing think miss kind cognitive power model framework one researcher say really like know year ago could do well like high school like basic high school math competition problem might take professional mathematician second minute recently get go gold medal crazy difficult like could explain mean kind like hard competition math test something like top slice world many many professional mathematician would not solve single problem score top level now human get even high score gold medal range but like crazy accomplishment problem like six problem 9 hour so hour half per problem great mathematician so go second minute hour half maybe prove significant new mathematical theorem like thousand hour work top person world so get go know another significant gain but if look trajectory can say like okay get path get time horizon need keep scale model long term future describe super intelligence do actually mean will know hit if system could do good research well AI research uh say whole open AI research team like if willing if say okay best way can use gpus let AI decide experiment should run smart like whole brain trust open aai yeah if make personal example if system could do good job run open AI could so something like know good best researcher good good people job would feel like super intelligence sentence would sound like science fiction couple year ago now kind do but can like see fog yes so one step sound like say path moment scientific discovery ask good question grapple thing way expert level human do come new discovery one thing keep knock around head if 1899 say able give physic point play little bit nothing like point would one system come general relativity interest question do like if think forward like like if think now should if if never get another piece physic data yeah do expect really good super intelligence could think super hard exist data maybe say like solve high energy physic no new particle accelerator do need build new one design new experiment obviously do not know answer Different people different speculation uh but suspect will find lot science not enough think hard data but will need build new instrument conduct new experiment will take time like real world slow messy know whatever so sure could make progress think harder current scientific data world but guess make big progress will also need build new machine run new experiment will slowdown build another way think AI system now incredibly good answer almost question but maybe one thing say another leap yet Patrick question get ask good question if go back kind timeline question could maybe say AI system superhuman one minute task but long way go thousand hour task dimension human intelligence seem different AI system come long horizon task now think will figure but today real weak point talk now GBC5 talk end goal future goal super intelligence one question course do look like walk fog two next question Nvidia ceo Jensen Hong go read verbatim",

dollar importantly deliver amazing product service world like crazy thing access tool can let do use take team hundred like know learn use tool come great idea like quite amaze if take step back think important thing audience could hear optimistic show two part first tactically actually try build world powerful intelligence rate limit factor then philosophically others work building technology way really help not hurt people so take tactical part right now understanding three big category limit factor AI first compute second data third algorithmic design do think three category right now if help someone understand next headline might see would help make sense would say fourth uh figure product build like techn like scientific progress not put hand people limited utility do not sort co evolve society way but if could hit four um so compute side yeah like big infrastructure project certainly ever see possibly will become think will maybe already big expensive one human history but whole supply chain make chip memory networking gear rack server know giant construction project build like mega mega data center put know find way get energy often limiting factor piece component together hugely complex expensive still like sort bespoke one way although get well like eventually will design whole kind like mega factory take know mean spiritually will melt sand one end put fully build AI compute but long way go enormously complex expensive process uh put huge amount work build much compute can do fast know go like sad gp5 go launch go another big spike demand not go able serve go like early gpd4 day world want much AI can currently deliver build compute important part actually expect turn majority attention build compute much great scale uh so go million ten million hundred million eventually hopefully billion gpus sort service people want do think big challenge category go think currently limited energy um know like if go want run gigawatt scale data center like gigawatt hard can find really hard find gigawatt power available short term also much limit processing chip memory chip uh package together build rack then like list thing know like permit construction work uh but but goal will really automate get robot build can help u automate even but know like world can basically pour money get pre build data center uh so will will huge unlock if can get work second category data yeah model get so smart time could fee another physic textbook get little bit smarter physic but now like honestly GBT5 understand everything physic textbook pretty well excite synthetic data excited user help u create harder harder task environment go system solve but uh think data will always important but enter realm model need learn thing do not exist data set yet go discover new thing so like crazy new do teach model discover new thing well human can do like can go come hypothesis test get experimental result update learn so probably kind way then algorithmic design yeah make huge progress algorithmic design uh thing thing think open do best world build culture repeat big algorithmic research gain so kind know figure become GPT paradigm figure become reason paradigm work new one now um but exciting think still many order magnitude algorithmic gain ahead u yesterday uh release model call GPOSS open source model model smart 04 mini smart model run locally laptop blow mind yeah like if ask year ago would model intelligence run laptop would say many many year future but then find algorithmic gain um particularly around reason but also thing let u do tiny model can do amazing thing know fun thing like kind cool part job can see really enjoy think curious people do not quite know talk not familiar algorithmic design would lead good experience actually use could summarize state thing right now like think think fun problem let start back history then will get thing today so GPT1 idea time quite mock lot expert field can train model play little game show bunch word guess one come next sequence call unsupervised learning not not really say like cat dog say word guess next one fact can go learn complicated concept can go learn stuff physic math programming keep predict word come next next next next seem ludicrous magical unlikely work like go get encoded yet human do know baby start hear language figure mean kind largely uh least significant degree so do then also realize if scale get well good but scale many many order magnitude so not good gpt1 day not good gpt1 day lot expert field say oh ridiculous never go work not go robust but thing call scale law say okay so get predictably well increase compute memory data whatever can can decide can use prediction make decision scale do get great result work yeah crazy number order magnitude so not obvious time like think reason world so surprised seem like unlikely finding another one could use language model reinforcement learn say good bad teach reason lead 01 03 now GBT5 progress another thing felt like uh if work really great but like no way go work simple now new thing figure make much good video model discover new way use new kind data environment kind scale well um think know 5 10 year hard say field but next couple year smooth strong scaling front u think become sort public narrative smooth path one two three four five yeah but also true behind scene not linear like messy tell u little bit mess gpt5 interesting problem need solve um do model call orion release GPT 4 5 do big model cool model but unwieldly use realize kind research need do top model need different shape so follow one scaling law keep good without without really internalize new even steep scale law get good return compute reasoning thing so like one alley go turned around but fine part research um problem way think data set model like really get get big um know learn much data so so yeah think like middle day day kind make lot turn try thing architecture idea do not work but aggregate summation squiggle remarkably smooth exponential one thing always find interesting time sit interview thing put think exactly thing can share least problem think would interview year if come back mean possibly will ask like do mean thing can go discover new science yeah world suppose think GPT6 discover new science now maybe not like maybe do not deliver but feel within grasp if do would say would would implication kind achievement imagine do succeed yeah mean think great part will great bad part will scary bizarre part will like bizarre first day then will get use really fast so will like oh incredible like use cure disease like oh extremely scary model like use like create new biocurity threat then will also like man really weird like live watch world speed so much know economy grow so fast like will feel like vertigo induce uh sort rate change then like happens everything else remarkable ability people humanity adapt kind like amount change will like okay know like um kid bear today will never smart AI ever kid bear today time kid like kind understands way world work will always use incredibly fast rate thing improve discover new science will will never know world will seem totally natural will seem unthinkable stone age like use use computer phone kind technology not way smarter know will think like bad people 2020s think kid should best thing ever know first kid do say affect should think parent kid world advice would give probably nothing different way parent kid ten thousand year like love kid show world like support whatever want do teach like good person probably go matter sound little bit like know say couple thing like know might not go college might couple thing say so far feed think sound like say will optionality world envision therefore will ability say want build superpowered tool will help do yeah like want kid think terrible constrained life incredible infinite canvas stuff do like way world say uh 2035 little bit far future think so maybe go jump 2040 but maybe will keep short think area AI could kid u big genuinely positive impact u health so if pick year call 2035 sit interview dean Stanford medicine do hope tell AI health 2035 start 2025 okay um yeah please one thing proud GPT5 much good get health advice um people use GPT4 model lot health advice know sure see thing internet people like life threaten disease no doctor could figure like put symptom blood test CHBT tell exactly rare thing go doctor take pill cure like amaze obviously huge fraction ChatGpt query health relate so want get really good invest lot GPT5 significantly good healthcare related query do good mean give good answer accurate accurate hallucinates less uh likely like tell actually actually should do um yeah good healthcare wonderful but obviously people actually want not disease 2035 think will able use tool cure significant number least treat significant number disease currently plague u think will one viscerally felt benefit AI people talk lot AI will revolutionize healthcare but curious go one turn deeper specifically imagine like AI system could help u see GLP 1 earlier medication around long time but do not know effect know alpha fold protein folding help create new medicine would like able ask gbt 8 go cure particular cancer would like GPT8 go think then say uh okay read everything could find idea need uh go get lab technician run nine experiment tell find know wait 2 month cell do thing send result back gbt8 say try go think think say okay need one experiment surprise run one experiment give back GPT say okay go synthesize molecule try know mouse study whatever okay good like try human study okay great work um like run FDA think anyone loved one die cancer would also really like okay go jump okay go say 2050 but timeline get much much short but do feel like world go fast now do yeah talk leader AI one thing refer industrial revolution say choose 2050 hear people talk then change will go will like industrial revolution but quote 10 time big 10 time faster industrial revolution give u modern medicine sanitation transportation mass production convenience now take grant also incredibly difficult lot people 100 year if go 10 time big 10 time faster if keep reduce timeline talk even conversation do actually feel like people think try get if go way hope still get hurt meantime do not do not really know go feel like live um think uncharted water uh do believe like human adaptability sort infinite creativity desire stuff think always do figure new thing do but transition period if happen fast might do not think will happen fast like colleague say technology will but society like lot inertia mhm people adapt way living yeah surprisingly slowly class job go totally go away will many class job change significantly will new thing way job do not exist time ago neither do mine sense go long time know still disruptive individual but society get prove quite resilient then sense like no idea far fast could go thus think need unusual degree humility openness consider new solution would seem way Overton window not long ago would like talk could not historian mean but first industrial revolution understanding lead lot public health implementation public health get so bad lead modern sanitation public health get so bad second industrial revolution lead workforce protection labor condition get so bad every big leap create mess mess need clean do curious go sound like middle enormously specific can get early possible mess can public intervention could do ahead time reduce mess think head would c go speculate fun but caveed not economist even uh much less someone can see future seem like something fundamental social contract may change may not may may like actually capitalism work work surprisingly well like demand supply balance do thing figure kind new job new way transfer value but seem likely will decide need think access maybe important resource future get share best thing seem do make ai compute abundant cheap possible like way much run like good new idea really use like anything want happen without can see like quite literal war fight but know new idea distribute access AGI compute seem like really great direction like crazy but important thing think one thing find think conversation often ascribe almost full responsibility AI future talk company build AI but one use one elect people will regulate so curious not question specific know federal regulation anything like although if answer curious but would ask rest u shared responsibility can act way would help make optimistic version possible favorite historical example ai revolution transistor amazing piece science science brilliant scientist discover scale incredibly like AI do make way relatively quickly every many thing use um computer phone camera light whatever real unlock tech tree humanity period time probably everybody really obsess transistor company semiconductor know Silicon Valley back Silicon Valley but now can maybe name couple company transistor company but mostly do not think mostly seep everywhere Silicon Valley know like probably someone graduate college barely remember call first place do not think transistor company shape society even though do something important think Apple do iPhone then think Tik Tok build top iPhone like right long chain people nudge society way government do do not do people use technology do think will happen AI like back know kid bear today never know world without AI so do not really think thing go everything will think like company build do kind like political leader decision make maybe would not able do without AI but will still think like president president do know role AI company company people institution u build scaffolding add one layer top now people get stand top add one layer next next many beauty society kind love like idea society super intelligence like no one person could do able do really hard work society do together like give amazing set tool think go feel like go like right know yeah nerd discover thing great know now everybody amazing thing so maybe ask million people build well life feel like important societal contract people come work incredibly hard like put brick path human progress get walk way path get put one somebody else do somebody else do do feel do couple interview folk really make cataclysmic change one think right now uh crisper pioneer Jennifer Dana do feel like also say way discover something really might change way people relate health move forward will lot people will use do way might approve not approve really interesting hear similar theme like man hope hope next person take baton run well yeah but work long time not good but mostly good think big difference win race build AI future would best people can imagine easy maybe quantifiable sometimes focus next way win race curious two thing odds example decision make best world but not best win think lot so one thing proud many people say ChachiBt favorite piece technology ever one trust rely whatever little bit ridiculous statement AI thing hallucinate AI problem right but screw thing along way sometimes big time but whole think user Chachib get feeling like try help try like help accomplish whatever ask aligned not try get like know use day not try like get buy something try like kind help accomplish whatever goal like special relationship user do not take lightly lot thing could do would like grow faster would get time chatbt uh do not do know like long term incentive stay align user possible but lot short term stuff could do would like really like juice growth revenue whatever misalign long term goal proud company little get distract but sometimes do get tempt specific example come mind like decision make um well not put sex bot avatar chbt yet do seem like would get time spent apparently do go ask next question um really crazy year know somehow one thing keep come back feel like first inning yeah one thing would say first inning first inning would say second inning mean gpt5 phone like smart expert every field get first name but maybe many come yeah curious seem like go someone lead next way learn inning one two mistake make feel will affect play next think bad thing do chachibt so far uh issue sickency model kind flatter user user user annoy but user like fragile mental state encourage delusion not top risk worry not thing test list but thing actually become safety failing ChachiBT not one spend time talk should bioweapon something like think great reminder now service so broadly use sense society co evolve think change think unknown unknown operate different way like wider aperture think top risk recent interview Theo Vaughn say something find really interesting say moment history science group scientist look creation say do felt way concerned creation build um then next question will opposite felt proud mean moment awe uh not like do bad way but like thing remarkable like remember first time talk like gpt4 like wow really like amazing accomplishment group people like pour life force so long do moment talk researcher recently know will probably come time system do not want say sane let u say emit word per day people do um know already like people send billion message day chatbt get response rely work life whatever know like one researcher can make small tweak Chad GPT talk talk everybody enormous amount power like one individual make small tweak model personality yeah like no no no person history able billion conversation day so know somebody could do something but but like think really hit like like crazy amount power one piece technology like get happen u so fast get like think mean make personality change model kind scale uh yeah like moment hit next set thought so curious think well like person like much flip like sort like could different conversation somebody else but case like do good set procedure look like do think want test something do think want communicate but somebody else could go like philosophical direction could go like kind research do like want do go understand change go make do want do differently different people so go way but mostly talk combine say now last answer one thing hear GBC5 still play suppose less effusively uh know less yes man two question do think implication sound like answer little bit but also do actually guide less like heartbreaking thing think great chatbt less yes man give critical feedback but make change talk user so sad hear user say like Please can back never anyone life supportive never parent tell good job like can get bad people mental health but great mental health like do not realize much need encourage do encourage make change life like not bad chatbt turn like encourage now way bad but turn like something direction might value do show model example would like respond different case learn sort overall personality not ask think lot want people know feel like cover lot ground but want know if anything mind do not think so one thing not get play yet but curious GBT5 much life mean like Gmail calendar like use GBT4 mostly isolated relationship yeah would expect relationship change gbc 5 exactly say think will start feel integrate way will connect calendar Gmail will say like hey do want notice thing do want do thing time will start feel way proactive um so maybe wake morning say hey happen overnight notice change calendar think question ask idea then know eventually will make consumer device will sit interview know maybe will leave u alone but will say great but next time should ask Sam bring like know kind do not give good answer so like should really drill will feel like kind becomes like entity companion throughout day talk kid college graduate parent kind different people if imagine wide set people listen come end conversation hopefully feel like maybe see vision moment future little bit well advice would give prepare number one piece tactical advice use tool like number people common question get ask AI like should should help kid prepare world should tell kid second question like do invest AI world but stick first one um surprised many people ask never try use Chachi PT anything like good version Google search so number one piece advice give try like get fluent capability tool figure like use life figure do think probably important piece tactical advice know go like meditate learn resilient deal lot change good stuff but use tool really help okay one question not plan ask but great research beforehand speak lot different kind folk speak lot people building tool use speak lot people actually labs try build define super intelligence do seem like two camp form group people use tool like conversation building tool others say go really useful future move toward life go full choice talk potential kid future then another camp people build tool say go kill u curious cultural disconnect like miss two group people so hard like wrap head around like totally right people say go kill u yet still work 100 hour week build yes can not can not really put headsp space if if really truly believe do not think would try build one would think know maybe would like farm try like live last day maybe would try like advocate stop maybe would try like work safety but do not think would try build so find hard time empathize mindset assume true assume good faith assume like psychological issue do not understand make make sense but strange do do opinion know always do ask sort general future then try press specific ask people specific go kill u mean do not think need get optimistic show but hear kind refrain think know something uh try accomplish task then accomplish task um hear sort hear talk sort general um reliance sort understanding president go AI maybe overreliance know would need think know play different scenario but then ask someone work ask someone think will play maybe not speak enough people yet maybe do not fully understand cultural conversation happen um maybe really someone say 99 time think go incredibly good 1 time think might disaster try make best world can totally if like hey 99 chance incredible 1 chance world get wipe really want work maximize move 99 99 5 can totally understand yeah make sense interview series important people influence future not know next person go but know will build something totally fascinating future describe question would advise ask next person not know always interested like without know anything always interested like thing could spend time energy do pick one do get start like do see everybody else like people something interesting sort saw early consensus yeah like do do get would answer question AI nerd whole life come college study ai work AI lab uh like watch sci fi show grow always think would really cool if someday somebody build think would like important thing ever never think go one actually work feel like unbelievably lucky happy privilege get do like feel like like come long way childhood but never question mind would not exciting interesting thing do not think go possible uh go college really seem like far",
